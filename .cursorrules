# Development Approach

This project follows the Feature-Driven Development (FDD) methodology.
- Folder src/features/ contains Feature-Driven Modules.
  Each feature is treated as a self-contained module (like a mini app) that includes following folders:
  - pages/ (Feature-specific screens)
  - components/ (Reusable UI elements for the feature)
  - services/ (API communication and business logic)
  - store/ (Redux toolkit slice management)
  - hooks/ (Custom React hooks, integrate store and services)
  - routes/ (Feature-specific routing)
  - types/ (TypeScript definitions for feature-related data)
This structure ensures modularity, maintainability, and scalability.

# Core Technologies & Tools

- Vite: Used for bundling and development. The project was created using the React TypeScript template preset.
- React: Build the application using React with TypeScript support.
- Material UI (MUI): Use the Material UI library for styling and UI components.

# Routing & State Management

- React Router 7: Use React Router 7 for managing routing.
- Since React Router DOM is deprecated, import routing components from react-router instead of react-router-dom.
- Redux Toolkit: Use Redux Toolkit for global state management across the application.

# Backend Communication & Authentication

- API Communication: The project will communicate with a backend API for data exchange
- Ensure that requests are properly handled and state is effectively managed.
- Firebase Auth: Use Firebase Auth for authentication.

# Development Best Practices

- TypeScript First
- Use TypeScript types everywhere to ensure type safety.
- Avoid using any; prefer explicit types for function arguments and return values.

# JSON API Specification

- Follow the JSON API specification for API communication.
- Ensure proper handling of:
- Data (Standardized API responses)
- Errors (Consistent error structures)
- Meta (Metadata about API responses)
- Pagination (Standardized pagination structure)

# Folder Structure Guidelines

## Key Folders

- src/components/: Shared UI components across features
- src/config/: Environment variables, constants, and API endpoints
- src/hooks/: Custom React hooks
- src/services/: API service functions and authentication logic
- src/store/: Redux Toolkit state management
- src/utils/: Utility functions for formatting, validation, etc.

# Instructions
- Use some-file-name.ts or some-file-name.tsx instead of index.ts or index.tsx.

Available rules:
@split-file - use this rule when you need to split file into smaller files.
